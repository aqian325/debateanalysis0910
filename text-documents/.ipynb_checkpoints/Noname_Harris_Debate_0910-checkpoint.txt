Kamala Harris
Thank you
So I was raised as a middleclass kid And I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class and working people of America I believe in the ambition the aspirations the dreams of the American people And that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity economy Because heres the thing We know that we have a shortage of homes and housing and the cost of housing is too expensive for far too many people We know that young families need support to raise their children
Well I would love to
So Donald Trump has no plan for you And when you look at his economic plan its all about tax breaks for the richest people I am offering what I describe as an opportunity economy and the best economists in our country if not the world have reviewed our relative plans for the future of America What Goldman Sachs has said is that Donald Trumps plan would make the economy worse Mine would strengthen the economy What the Wharton School has said is Donald Trumps plan would actually explode the deficit Sixteen Nobel laureates have described his economic plan as something that would increase inflation and by the middle of next year would invite a recession You just have to look at where we are and where we stand on the issues And Id invite you to know that Donald Trump actually has no plan for you because he is more interested in defending himself than he is in looking out for you
Well lets be clear that the Trump administration resulted in a trade deficit one of the highest weve ever seen in the history of America He invited trade wars you wanna talk about his deal with China what he ended up doing is under Donald Trumps presidency he ended up selling American chips to China to help them improve and modernize their military basically sold us out when a policy about China should be in making sure the United States of America wins the competition for the st century Which means focusing on the details of what that requires focusing on relationships with our allies focusing on investing in American based technology so that we win the race on AI and quantum computing focusing on what we need to do to support Americas workforce so that we dont end up having the on the short end of the stick in terms of workers rights But what Donald Trump did lets talk about this with COVID is he actually thanked President XI for what he did during COVID Look at his tweet
Well as I said youre going to hear a bunch of lies And thats not actually a surprising fact Lets understand how we got here Donald Trump handselected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v Wade And they did exactly as he intended And now in over  states there are Trump abortion bans which make it criminal for a doctor or nurse to provide health care In one state it provides prison for life Trump abortion bans that make no exception even for rape and incest Which understand what that means A survivor of a crime a violation to their body does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next That is immoral And one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body
I have talked with women around our country You want to talk about this is what people wanted Pregnant women who want to carry a pregnancy to term suffering from a miscarriage being denied care in an emergency room because the health care providers are afraid they might go to jail and shes bleeding out in a car in the parking lot She didnt want that Her husband didnt want that A  or yearold survivor of incest being forced to carry a pregnancy to term They dont want that And I pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to put back in place the protections of Roe v Wade as president of the United States I will proudly sign it into law But understand if Donald Trump were to be reelected he will sign a national abortion ban Understand in his Project  there would be a national abortion ban Understand in his Project  there would be a national abortion  a monitor that would be monitoring your pregnancies your miscarriages I think the American people believe that certain freedoms in particular the freedom to make decisions about ones own body should not be made by the government
I absolutely support reinstating the protections of Roe v Wade And as you rightly mentioned nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion That is not happening Its insulting to the women of America And understand what has been happening under Donald Trumps abortion bans Couples who pray and dream of having a family are being denied IVF treatments What is happening in our country working people working women who are working one or two jobs who can barely afford childcare as it is have to travel to another state to get on a plane sitting next to strangers to go and get the health care she needs Barely can afford to do it And what you are putting her through is unconscionable And the people of America have not  the majority of Americans believe in a womans right to make decisions about her own body And that is why in every state where this issue has been on the ballot in red and blue states both the people of America have voted for freedom
Come on
Why dont you answer the question would you veto –
Answer the question would you veto
Thats not true
So Im the only person on this stage who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations for the trafficking of guns drugs and human beings And let me say that the United States Congress including some of the most conservative members of the United States Senate came up with a border security bill which I supported And that bill would have put  more border agents on the border to help those folks who are working there right now over time trying to do their job It would have allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States I know there are so many families watching tonight who have been personally affected by the surge of fentanyl in our country That bill would have put more resources to allow us to prosecute transnational criminal organizations for trafficking in guns drugs and human beings But you know what happened to that bill Donald Trump got on the phone called up some folks in Congress and said kill the bill And you know why Because he preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem And understand this comes at a time where the people of our country actually need a leader who engages in solutions who actually addresses the problems at hand But what we have in the former president is someone who would prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem And Ill tell you something hes going to talk about immigration a lot tonight even when its not the subject that is being raised And Im going to actually do something really unusual and Im going to invite you to attend one of Donald Trumps rallies because its a really interesting thing to watch You will see during the course of his rallies he talks about fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter He will talk about windmills cause cancer And what you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom And I will tell you the one thing you will not hear him talk about is you You will not hear him talk about your needs your dreams and your your desires And Ill tell you I believe you deserve a president who actually puts you first And I pledge to you that I will
Talk about extreme Um you know this is I think one of the reasons why in this election I actually have the endorsement of  Republicans who have formally worked with President Bush Mitt Romney and John McCain including the endorsement of former Vice President Dick Cheney and Congressmember Liz Cheney And if you want to really know the inside track on who the former president is if he didnt make it clear already just ask people who have worked with him His former chief of staff a fourstar general has said he has contempt for the constitution of the United States His former national security adviser has said he is dangerous and unfit His former secretary of defense has said the nation the republic would never survive another Trump term And when we listen to this kind of rhetoric when the issues that affect the American people are not being addressed I think the choice is clear in this election
Well I think this is so rich Coming from someone who has been prosecuted for national security crimes economic crimes election interference has been found liable for sexual assault and his next big court appearance is in November at his own criminal sentencing And lets be clear where each person stands on the issue of what is important about respect for the rule of law and respect for law enforcement The former vice president called for defunding federal law enforcement  agents get this on the day after he was arraigned on  felony counts So lets talk about what is important in this race It is important that we move forward that we turn the page on this same old tired rhetoric And address the needs of the American people address what we
Well lets talk about extreme And understand the context in which this election in  is taking place The United States Supreme Court recently ruled that the former president would essentially be immune from any misconduct if he were to enter the white house again Understand this is someone who has openly said he would terminate Im quoting terminate the constitution of the United States That he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies Someone who has openly expressed disdain for members of our military Understand what it would mean if Donald Trump were back in the white house with no guardrails Because certainly we know now the court wont stop him We know JD Vance is not going to stop him Its up to the American people to stop him
So my values have not changed And Im going to discuss every one  at least every point that youve made But in particular lets talk about fracking because were here in Pennsylvania I made that very clear in  I will not ban fracking I have not banned fracking as Vice President of the United States And in fact I was the tiebreaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act which opened new leases for fracking My position is that we have got to invest in diverse sources of energy so we reduce our reliance on foreign oil We have had the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil As it relates to my values let me tell you I grew up a middleclass kid raised by a hardworking mother who worked and saved and was able to buy our first home when I was a teenager The values I bring to the importance of home ownership knowing not everybody got handed  million on a silver platter and then filed bankruptcy six times is a value that I bring to my work to say we are going to work with the private sector and home builders to increase  million homes increase by  million homes by the end of my first term My work that is related to having a friend when I was in high school who was sexually assaulted by her stepfather And my focus then on protecting women and children from violent crime is based on a value that is deeply grounded in the importance of standing up for those who are most vulnerable My work that is about protecting social security and Medicare is based on longstanding work that I have done Protecting seniors from scams My values have not changed And what is important is that there is a president who actually brings values and a perspective that is about lifting people up and not beating people down and namecalling The true measure of the leader is the leader who actually understands that strength is not in beating people down its in lifting people up I intend to be that president
Thats not true mouthed not audible
Dont lie lie is audible
I was at the Capitol on January th I was the Vice PresidentElect I was also an acting senator I was there And on that day the president of the United States incited a violent mob to attack our nations Capitol to desecrate our nations Capitol On that day  law enforcement officers were injured And some died And understand the former president has been indicted and impeached for exactly that reason But this is not an isolated situation Lets remember Charlottesville where there was a mob of people carrying tiki torches spewing antisemitic hate and what did the president then at the time say There were fine people on each side Lets remember that when it came to the Proud Boys a militia the president said the former president said Stand back and stand by So for everyone watching who remembers what January th was I say we dont have to go back Lets not go back Were not going back Its time to turn the page And if that was a bridge too far for you well there is a place in our campaign for you To stand for country To stand for our democracy To stand for rule of law And to end the chaos And to end the approach that is about attacking the foundations of our democracy cause you dont like the outcome And be clear on that point Donald Trump the candidate has said in this election there will be a bloodbath if this  and the outcome of this election is not to his liking Lets turn the page on this Lets not go back Lets chart a course for the future and not go backwards to the past
Donald Trump was fired by  million people So lets be clear about that And clearly he is having a very difficult time processing that But we cannot afford to have a president of the United States who attempts as he did in the past to upend the will of the voters in a free and fair election And Im going to tell you that I have traveled the world as vice president of the United States And world leaders are laughing at Donald Trump I have talked with military leaders some of whom worked with you And they say youre a disgrace And when you then talk in this way in a presidential debate and deny what over and over again are court cases you have lost because you did in fact lose that election it leads one to believe that perhaps we do not have in the candidate to my right the temperament or the ability to not be confused about fact Thats deeply troubling And the American people deserve better
Well lets understand how we got here On Oct  Hamas a terrorist organization slaughtered  Israelis Many of them young people who were simply attending a concert Women were horribly raped And so absolutely I said then I say now Israel has a right to defend itself We would And how it does so matters Because it is also true far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed Children mothers What we know is that this war must end It must when end immediately and the way it will end is we need a ceasefire deal and we need the hostages out And so we will continue to work around the clock on that Work around the clock also understanding that we must chart a course for a twostate solution And in that solution there must be security for the Israeli people and Israel and in equal measure for the Palestinians But the one thing I will assure you always I will always give Israel the ability to defend itself in particular as it relates to Iran and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel But we must have a twostate solution where we can rebuild Gaza where the Palestinians have security selfdetermination and the dignity they so rightly deserve
Thats absolutely not true I have my entire career and life supported Israel and the Israeli people He knows that Hes trying to again divide and distract from the reality which is it is very well known that Donald Trump is weak and wrong on national security and foreign policy It is well known that he admires dictators wants to be a dictator on day one according to himself It is well known that he said of Putin that he can do whatever the hell he wants and go into Ukraine It is well known when that he said when Russia went into Ukraine it was brilliant It is well known he exchanged love letters with Kim Jong un And it is absolutely well known that these dictators and autocrats are rooting for you to be president again because theyre so clear they can manipulate you with flattery and favors And that is why so many military leaders who you have worked with have told me you are a disgrace That is why we understand that we have to have a president who is not consistently weak and wrong on national security including the importance of upholding and respecting in highest regard our military
Well first of all its important to remind the former president youre not running against Joe Biden youre running against me I believe the reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within  hours is because he would just give it up And thats not who we are as Americans Lets understand what happened here I actually met with Zelenskyy a few days before Russia invaded tried through force to change territorial boundaries to defy one of the most important international rules and norms which is the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity And I met with President Zelenskyy I shared with him American intelligence about how he could defend himself Days later I went to NATOs eastern flank to Poland and Romania And through the work that I and others did we brought  countries together to support Ukraine in its righteous defense And because of our support because of the air defense the ammunition the artillery the javelins the Abrams tanks that we have provided Ukraine stands as an independent and free country If Donald Trump were president Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now And understand what that would mean Because Putins agenda is not just about Ukraine Understand why the European allies and our NATO allies are so thankful that you are no longer president and that we understand the importance of the greatest military alliance the world has ever known which is NATO And what we have done to preserve the ability of Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians to fight for their Independence Otherwise Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe Starting with Poland And why dont you tell the  Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch
inaudible
Yet again I said it at the beginning of this debate youre going to hear a bunch of lies coming from this fella And that is another one When I went to meet with President Zelenskyy Ive now met with him over five times The reality is it has been about standing as America always should as a leader upholding international rules and norms As a leader who shows strength understanding that the alliances we have around the world are dependent on our ability to look out for our friends and not favor our enemies because you adore strongmen instead of caring about democracy And that is very much what is at stake here The President of the United States is commanderinchief And the American people have a right to rely on a president who understands the significance of Americas role and responsibility in terms of ensuring that there is stability and ensuring we stand up for our principles and not sell them for the benefit of personal flattery
Well I will tell you I agreed with President Bidens decision to pull out of Afghanistan Four presidents said they would and Joe Biden did And as a result Americas taxpayers are not paying the  million a day we were paying for that endless war And as of today there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world the first time this century But lets understand how we got to where we are Donald Trump when he was president negotiated one of the weakest deals you can imagine He calls himself a dealmaker Even his national security adviser said it was a weak terrible deal And heres how it went down He bypassed the Afghan government He negotiated directly with a terrorist organization called the Taliban The negotiation involved the Taliban getting  terrorists Taliban terrorists released
And get this  no get this And the president at the time invited the Taliban to Camp David A place of storied significance for us as Americans a place where we honor the importance of American diplomacy where we invite and receive respected world leaders And this former president as president invited them to Camp David because he does not again appreciate the role and responsibility of the President of the United States to be commander in chief with a level of respect And this gets back to the point of how he has consistently disparaged and demeaned members of our military fallen soldiers and the work that we must do to uphold the strength and the respect of the United States of America around the world
I think its – I mean honestly I think its a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be president who has consistently over the course of his career attempted to use race to divide the American people You know I do believe that the vast majority of us know that we have so much more in common than what separates us And we dont want this kind of approach that is just constantly trying to divide us and especially by race And lets remember how Donald Trump started He was a a a—land he owned land he owned buildings and he was investigated because he refused to rent property to Black families Lets remember this is the same individual who took out a fullpage ad in The New York Times calling for the execution of five young Black and Latino boys who were innocent the Central Park Five Took out a fullpage ad calling for their execution This is the same individual who spread birther lies about the first Black President of the United States And I think the American people want better than that Want better than this Want someone who understands as I do I travel our country we see in each other a friend We see in each other a neighbor We dont want a leader who is constantly trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other I meet with people all the time who tell me Can we please just have discourse about how were going to invest in the aspirations and the ambitions and the dreams of the American people Knowing that regardless of peoples color or the language their grandmother speaks we all have the same dreams and aspirations and want a president who invests in those not in hate and division
I want to respond to that though I want to just respond briefly Clearly I am not Joe Biden and I am certainly not Donald Trump And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country One who believes in what is possible one who brings a sense of optimism about what we can do instead of always disparaging the American people I believe in what we can do to strengthen our small businesses which is why I have a plan Lets talk about our plans And and lets compare the plans I have a plan to give startup businesses  tax deduction to pursue their ambitions their innovation their ideas their hard work I have a plan  for young families for the first year of your childs life To help you in that most critical stage of your childs development I have a plan that is about allowing people to be able to pursue what has been fleeting in terms of the American dream by offering help with down payment of  down payment assistance for firsttime home buyers Thats the kind of conversation I believe David that people really want tonight as opposed to a conversation that is constantly about belittling and namecalling Lets turn the page and move forward
Well first of all I absolutely support and over the last four years as vice president private health care options But what we need to do is maintain and grow the Affordable Care Act But I Ill get to that linsey I just need to respond to a previous point that the former president has made Ive made very clear my position on fracking And then this business about taking everyones guns away Tim Walz and I are both gun owners Were not taking anybodys guns away So stop with the continuous lying about this stuff As it relates to the Affordable Care Act understand just look at the history to know where people stand When Donald Trump was president  times he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act  times I was a senator at the time When I will never forget the early morning hours when it was up for a vote in the United States Senate and the late great John McCain who you have disparaged as being – uh you dont like him you said at the time because he got caught he was an American hero The late great John McCain I will never forget that night Walked onto the Senate floor and said no you dont No you dont No you dont get rid of the Affordable Care Act You have no plan And what the Affordable Care Act has done is eliminate the ability of insurance companies to deny people with preexisting conditions I dont have to tell the people watching tonight you remember what that was like Remember when an insurance company could deny if a child had asthma if someone was a breast cancer survivor if a grandparent had diabetes And thankfully as Ive been vice president and we over the last four years have strengthened the Affordable Care Act we have allowed for the first time Medicare to negotiate drug prices on behalf of you the American people Donald Trump said he was going to allow Medicare to negotiate dr drug prices He never did We did And now we have capped the cost of insulin at  a month Since Ive been vice president we have capped the cost of prescription medication for seniors at  a year And when I am president we will do that for all people understanding that the value I bring to this is that access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it And the plan has to be to strengthen the Affordable Care Act not get rid of it in audible in terms of where Donald Trump stands on that
Well the former president had said that climate change is a hoax And what we know is that it is very real You ask anyone who lives in a state who has experienced these extreme weather occurrences who now is either being denied home insurance or is being jacked up You ask anybody who has been the victim of what that means in terms of losing their home having nowhere to go We know that we can actually deal with this issue The young people of America care deeply about this issue And I am proud that as vice president over the last four years we have invested a trillion dollars in a clean energy economy while we have also increased domestic gas production to historic levels We have created over  new manufacturing jobs while I have been vice president We have invested in clean energy to the point that we are opening up factories around the world Donald Trump said he was going to create manufacturing jobs He lost manufacturing jobs And Im also proud to have the endorsement of the United Auto Workers and Shawn Fain who also know that part of building a clean energy economy includes investing in Americanmade products American automobiles It includes growing what we can do around American manufacturing and opening up auto plants not closing them like what happened under Donald Trump
So I think youve heard tonight two very different visions for our country One that is focused on the future and the other that is focused on the past And an attempt to take us backward But were not going back And I do believe that the American people know we all have so much more in common than what separates us and we can chart a new way forward And a vision of that includes having a plan understanding the aspirations the dreams the hopes the ambition of the American people which is why I intend to create an opportunity economy investing in small businesses in new families in what we can do around protecting seniors what we can do that is about giving hardworking folks a break in bringing down the cost of living I believe in what we can do together that is about sustaining Americas standing in the world and ensuring we have the respect that we so rightly deserve including respecting our military and ensuring we have the most lethal fighting force in the world I will be a president that will protect our fundamental rights and freedoms including the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do Ill tell you I started my career as a prosecutor I was a DA I was an attorney general A United States senator And now vice president Ive only had one client The people And Ill tell you as a prosecutor I never asked a victim or a witness are you a Republican or a Democrat The only thing I ever asked them are you okay And thats the kind of president we need right now Someone who cares about you and is not putting themselves first I intend to be a president for all Americans and focus on what we can do over the next  and  years to build back up our country by investing right now in you the American people
