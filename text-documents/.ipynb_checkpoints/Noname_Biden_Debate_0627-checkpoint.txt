JOE BIDEN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES How are you Good to be here Thank you
 You have to take a look at what I was left when I became president what Mr Trump left me We had an economy that was in freefall The pandemic are so badly handled many people were dying All he said was its not that serious Just inject a little bleach in your arm Itd be all right The economy collapsed There were no jobs Unemployment rate rose to  percent It was terrible And so what we had to do is try to put things back together again Thats exactly what we began to do We created  new jobs We brought on – in a position where we have  new manufacturing jobs But theres more to be done Theres more to be done Working class people are still in trouble I come from Scranton Pennsylvania I come from a household where the kitchen table – if things werent able to be met during the month was a problem Price of eggs the price of gas the price of housing the price of a whole range of things Thats why Im working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems And were going to make sure that we reduce the price of housing Were going to make sure we build  million new units Were going to make sure we cap rents so corporate greed cant take over The combination of what I was left and then corporate greed are the reason why were in this problem right now In addition to that were in a situation where if you had – take a look at all that was done in his administration he didnt do much at all By the time he left theres – things had been in chaos There was ph literally chaos And so we put things back together We created as I said those ph jobs We made sure we had a situation where we now – we brought down the price of prescription drugs which is a major issue for many people to  for – for an insulin shot as opposed to  No senior has to pay more than  for any drug – all the drugs they inaudible beginning next year And the situation is making – and were going to make that available to everybody to all Americans So were working to bring down the prices around the kitchen table And thats what were going to get done
 Well look the greatest economy in the world hes the only one who thinks that I think I dont know anybody else who thinks it was great – he had the greatest economy in the world And you know the fact of the matter is that we found ourselves in a situation where his economy – he rewarded the wealthy He had the largest tax cut in American history  trillion He raised the deficit larger than any president has in any one term Hes the only president other than Herbert Hoover who has lost more jobs than he had when he began since Herbert Hoover The idea that he did something that was significant And the military – you know when he was president they were still killing people in Afghanistan He didnt do anything about that When he was president we still found ourselves in a position where you had a notion that we were this safe country The truth is Im the only president this century that doesnt have any – this – this decade – doesnt have any troops dying anywhere in the world like he did
 He had the largest national debt of any president fouryear period number one Number two he got  trillion tax cut benefited the very wealthy What Im going to do is fix the taxes For example we have a thousand trillionaires in America – I mean billionaires in America And whats happening Theyre in a situation where they in fact pay  percent in taxes If they just paid  percent or  percent either one of those numbers theyd raised  million – billion dollars I should say in a year period Wed be able to right – wipe out his debt Wed be able to help make sure that – all those things we need to do childcare elder care making sure that we continue to strengthen our healthcare system making sure that were able to make every single solitary person eligible for what Ive been able to do with the COVID – excuse me with dealing with everything we have to do with Look if – we finally beat Medicare
 Its been a terrible thing what youve done The fact is that the vast majority of constitutional scholars supported Roe when it was decided supported Roe And I was – thats – this idea that they were all against it is just ridiculous And this is the guy who says the states should be able to have it Were in a state where in six weeks you dont even know whether youre pregnant or not but you cannot see a doctor have your – and have him decide on what your circumstances are whether you need help The idea that states are able to do this is a little like saying were going to turn civil rights back to the states let each state have a different rule Look theres so many young women who have been – including a young woman who just was murdered and he went to the funeral The idea that she was murdered by – by – by an immigrant coming in and inaudible talk about that But heres the deal theres a lot of young women who are being raped by their – by their inlaws by their – by their spouses brothers and sisters by – just – its just – its just ridiculous And they can do nothing about it And they try to arrest them when they cross state lines
 I supported Roe v Wade which had three trimesters First time is between a woman and a doctor Second time is between a doctor and an extreme situation A third time is between the doctor – I mean itd be between the woman and the state The idea that the politicians – that the founders wanted the politicians to be the ones making decisions about a womans health is ridiculous Thats the last – no politician should be making that decision A doctor should be making those decisions Thats how it should be run Thats what youre going to do And if Im elected Im going to restore Roe v Wade
 Hes lying That is simply not true That – Roe v Wade does not provide for that Thats not the circumstance Only when the womans life is in danger shes going to die thats the only circumstance in which that can happen But we are not for lateterm abortion period period period
 For  years that was the law  years constitutional scholarship said it was the right way to go  years And it was taken away because this guy put very conservative members on the Supreme Court Takes credit for taking it away Whats he going to do Whats he going to do in fact if – if the MAGA Republicans – he gets elected and the MAGA Republicans control the Congress and they pass a universal ban on abortion period across the board at six weeks or seven or eight or  weeks something very very conservative Is he going to sign that bill Ill veto it Hell sign it
 Because we worked very hard to get a bipartisan agreement that not only changed all of that it made sure that we are in a situation where you had no circumstance where they could come across the border with the number of border police there are now We significantly increased the number of asylum officers Significantly – by the way the Border Patrol endorsed me endorsed my position In addition to that we found ourselves in a situation where when he was president he was taking – separating babies from their mothers putting them in cages making sure the families were separated Thats not the right way to go What Ive done – since Ive changed the law whats happened Ive changed it in a way that now youre in a situation where there are  percent fewer people coming across the border illegally Its better than when he left office And Im going to continue to move until we get the total ban on the – the total initiative relative to what were going to do with more Border Patrol and more asylum officers
 The only terrorist who has done anything crossing the border is one who came along and killed three in his administration killed – an alQaida person in his administration killed three American soldiers killed three American soldiers Thats the only terrorist thats there Im not saying no terrorist ever got through But the idea theyre emptying their prisons were welcoming these people thats simply not true Theres no data to support what he said Once again hes exaggerating Hes lying
 Every single thing he said is a lie every single one For example veterans are a hell of a lot better off since I passed the PACT Act One million of them now have insurance and their families have it – and their families have it Because what happened whether was Agent Orange or burn pits theyre all being covered now And he opposed – his group opposed that Were also in a situation where we have great respect for veterans My – my son spent a year in Iraq living next to one of those burn pits Came back with stage four glioblastoma I was recently in – in – in France for DDay and I spoke to all – about those heroes that died I went to the World War II cemetery – World War I cemetery he refused to go to He was standing with his fourstar general and he told him – he said I dont want to go in there because theyre a bunch of losers and suckers My son was not a loser He was not a sucker Youre the sucker Youre the loser
 You had a fourstar general stand at your side who was on your staff who said you said it period Thats number one And number two the idea – the idea that I have to apologize to you for anything along the lines Weve done more for veterans than any president has in American history – American history And they now – and their family The only sacred obligation we have as a country is to care for our veterans when they come home and their families and equip them when they go to war Thats what were doing Thats what the VA is doing now Theyre doing more for veterans than ever before in our history
 Ive never heard so much malarkey in my whole life Look the fact of the matter is that were in a situation where – lets take the last point first  Iran attacked American troops killed caused brain damage for a number of these troops and he did nothing about it Recently – when he was president they attacked He said theyre just having headaches Thats all it is We didnt do a thing when the attack took place number one Number two we got over  Americans and others out of Afghanistan during that airlift Number three we found ourselves in a situation where if you take a look at what Trump did in Ukraine hes – this guy told Ukraine – told Trump do whatever you want Do whatever you want And thats exactly what Trump did to Putin encouraged him do whatever you want And he went in And listen to what he said when he went in he was going to take Kyiv in five days remember Because its part of the old Soviet Union Thats what he wanted to reestablish Kyiv And he in fact didnt do it at all He didnt – wasnt able to get it done And theyve lost over – theyve lost thousands and thousands of troops  troops
 The fact is that Putin is a war criminal Hes killed thousands and thousands of people And he has made one thing clear He wants to reestablish what was part of the Soviet Empire Not just a piece he wants all of Ukraine Thats what he wants And then do you think hell stop there Do you think hell stop when he – if he takes Ukraine What do you think happens to Poland What do you think of Belarus What do you think happens to those NATO countries And so if you want a war you ought to find out what hes going to do Because if in fact he does what he says and walks away – by the way all that money we give Ukraine and weapons we make here in the United States We give them the weapons not the money at this point And our NATO allies have produced as much funding for Ukraine as we have Thats why its – thats why were strong
 Number one everyone from the United Nations Security Council straight through to the G to the Israelis and Netanyahu himself have endorsed the plan I put forward endorsed the plan I put forward which has three stages to it The first stage is trade the hostages for a ceasefire Second phase is a ceasefire with additional conditions The third phase is know – the end of the war The only one who wants the war to continue is Hamas number one Theyre the only ones standing out ph Were still pushing hard from – to get them to accept In the meantime whats happened in Israel Were finally – the only thing Ive denied Israel was pound bombs They dont work very well in populated areas They kill a lot of innocent people We are providing Israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them And by the way Im the guy that organized the world against Iran when they had a fullblown kind of ballistic – ballistic missile attack on Israel No one was hurt No – one Israeli was accidentally killed And it stopped We saved Israel We are the biggest producer of support for Israel than anyone in the world And so thats – therere two different things Hamas cannot be allowed to be continued We continue to send our experts and our intelligence people to how they can get Hamas like we did Bin Laden You dont have to do it And by the way theyve been greatly weakened Hamas greatly weakened And they should be They should be eliminated But you got to be careful for what you use these certain weapons among population centers
 Ive never heard so much foolishness This is a guy who wants to get out of NATO Youre going to stay in NATO or youre going to pull out of NATO The idea that we have – our strength lies in our alliances as well It may be a big ocean but were – inaudible able to avoid a war in Europe a major war in Europe What happens if in fact you have Putin continue to go into NATO We have an Article Five agreement attack on one is attack on all You want to start the nuclear war he keeps talking about go ahead let Putin go in and control Ukraine and then move on to Poland and other places See what happens then He has no idea what the hell hes talking about And by the way I got  other nations around the world to support Ukraine including Japan and South Korea because they understand that this was – this – this kind of dislocation has a serious threat to the whole world peace No – no major war in Europe has ever been able to be contained just to Europe
 Look he encouraged those folks to go up on Capitol Hill number one I sat in that dining room off the Oval Office – he sat there for three hours three hours watching begging – being begged by his vice president and a number of his colleagues and Republicans as well to do something to call for a stop to end it Instead he talked – theyve talked about these people being patriots and – and great patrons of America In fact he says hell now forgive them for what theyve done Theyve been convicted He says he wants to commute their sentences and say that – no He went to every single court in the nation I dont know how many cases scores of cases including the Supreme Court and they said they said – they said no no this guy this guy is responsible for doing what is being – was done He didnt do a damn thing And these people should be in jail And they should be the ones who are being held accountable And he wants to let them all out And now he says if he loses again such a whiner that he is that there could be a bloodbath
 The only person on this stage that is a convicted felon is the man Im looking at right now And the fact of the matter is he is – what hes telling you is simply not true The fact is that there was no effort on his part to stop what was going on up on Capitol Hill And all those people every one of those who were convicted deserves to be convicted The idea that they didnt kill somebody just went in and broke down doors broke the windows occupied offices turned over desks turned them over statues – the idea that those people are patriots Come on When I asked him the first of two debates we had – debates we had the first time around I said will you denounce the Proud Boys He said no Ill tell them to stand by The idea hes refusing – will you denounce these guys Will you denounce the people were talking about now Will you denounce the people who attacked that Capitol What are you going to do
 The idea that I did anything wrong relative to what youre talking about is outrageous Its simply a lie number one Number two the idea that you have a right to seek retribution against any American just because youre a president is wrong is simply wrong No presidents ever spoken like that before No president in our history has spoken like that before Number three the crimes that you are still charged with – and think of all the civil penalties you have How many billions of dollars do you owe in civil penalties for molesting a woman in public for doing a whole range of things of having sex with a porn star on the night – and – while your wife was pregnant I mean what are you talking about You have the morals of an alley cat
 The more they know about what hes done yes The more they know about what hes done And theres a lot more coming Hes got a lot of cases around the road coming around Hes got – hes got a whole range of issues he has to face I dont know what the juries will do but I do know – I do know he has a real problem And so the fact that – could you ever think youre hearing any president say that Im going to seek retribution Do you ever hear any president say that he thought it might be a good idea What got me involved to run in the first place after my son had died I decided – in Iraq – because of Iraq I said I wasnt going to run again Until I saw what happened in Charlottesville Virginia people coming out of the woods carrying swastikas on torches – torches and singing the same antisemitic bile they sang when – back in Germany And what did – and the young woman got killed I spoke to the mother And she – they asked him they said what – well what do you think of those people the people who – the one who – the ones who tried to stop it and the ones who said I think theres fine people on both sides What American president would ever say Nazis coming out of fields carrying torches singing the same antisemitic bile carrying swastikas were fine people This is a guy who says Hitlers done some good things Id like to know what they are the good things Hitlers done Thats what he said This guy has no sense of American democracy
 And debunk It happened All you have to do is listen to what was said at the time And the idea that somehow thats the only reason I ran I ran because I was worried a guy like this guy can get elected If he thought they were good people coming out of that all – that forest carrying those – those woods carrying those torches then he didnt deserve to be president didnt deserve to be president at all And the idea that hes talking about all of this being fabricated we saw it with our own eyes We saw what happened on January  We saw the people breaking through the windows We saw people occupying there His own vice president – look theres a reason why  of his  top cabinet officers refused to endorse him this time His vice president hasnt endorsed him this time So why Why They know him well They serve with them Why are they not endorsing him
 They acknowledge he made a lot of progress number one The facts of the matter is more small black businesses that have been started in any time in history Number two the wages of black – black unemployment is the lowest level it has been in a long long time Number three we find them – theyre trying to provide housing for black Americans and dealing with segregation that exists among these corporate – these corporate operations that collude to keep people out of their houses And in addition to that we find that the impact of on the – the choice that black families have to make relative to childcare is incredibly difficult When we did the first major piece of legislation in the past I was able to reduce black childcare costs I cut them in half in half Weve got to make sure we provide for childcare costs Weve got to make sure – because when you provide that childcare protections you increase economic growth because more people can be in the – in the job market So theres more to be done considerably more to be done but weve done a great deal so far and Im not letting up and they know it
 I say I dont blame them for being disappointed Inflation is still hurting them badly For example I provided for the idea that any black family first time home buyer should get a  tax credit to be able to buy their first home so they can get started I made sure that were in a situation where all those black families and those black individuals who provided had to take out student loans that were ballooning that if they were engaged in nursing and anything having to do with volunteerism if they paid their bills for  years on their student debt all the rest was forgiven after  years Millions have benefited from that and were going to do a whole lot more for black families
 There was no inflation when I became president You know why The economy was flat on its back  percent unemployment he decimated the economy absolutely decimated the economy Thats why there was no inflation at the time There were no jobs We provided thousands of millions of jobs for individuals who were involved in communities including minority communities We made sure that they have health insurance We have covered with – the ACA has increased I made sure that theyre  per person in the family to get written off in health care but this guy wants to eliminate that They tried  times He wants to get rid of the ACA again and theyre going to try again if they win You find ourselves in a position where the idea that were not doing it I put more – we put more police on the street than any administration has He wants to cut the cops Were providing for equity equity and making sure people have a shot to make it There is a lot going on But on inflation he caused it by his tremendous malfeasance in the way he handled the pandemic
 I dont know where the hell he has been The idea that Dana he said is true Ive passed the most extensive it was the most extensive climate change legislation in history in history We find ourselves – and by the way black colleges I came up with  billion for HBCUs historic black universities and colleges because they dont have the kind of contributors that they have to build these laboratories and the like Any black student is capable in college in doing what any white student can do They just have the money But now theyll be able to get those jobs in high tech Were in a situation where the idea that he kind of is claiming to have done something that had the cleanest water the cleanest water He had not done a damn thing with the environment He – out of the Paris Peace Accord – Climate Accord I immediately joined it because if we reach for  degrees Celsius at any one point well there is no way back The only existential threat to humanity is climate change And he didnt do a damn thing about it He wants to undo all that Ive done
 Where does that come from The idea is that we in fact – we were the only ones of consequence or not who are not members of the Paris Accord How can we do anything when ph were not able to – the United States cant get its pollution under control One of the largest polluters in the world number one Were making significant progress By  we will have cut pollution in half We have – we have made significant progress And were continuing to make progress We set up a Climate Corps for thousands of young people will learn how to deal with climate just like the Peace Corps And were going to – were moving in directions that are going to significantly change the elements of the cause of pollution But the idea that he claims that he has the biggest heart up here and hes really concerned about – about pollution and about climate Ive not seen any indication of that And by the way with regard to prescription drugs one company agreed that they would reduce the price to  which I was calling for – one voluntarily I made sure every company in the world every pharmaceutical company cannot have to pay
 And by the way…
 Yes make the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share Right now everybody making under  pays  percent of their income of their paycheck every single time they get a paycheck from the time of the first one they get when theyre  years old The idea that theyre going to – Im not – Ive been proposing that everybody they pay – millionaires pay  percent –  percent So no one after – I would not raise the cost of Social Security for anybody under  After that I begin to make the wealthy begin to pay their fair share by increasing from  percent beyond to be able to guarantee the program for life
 Well that one enough will keep it solvent But the biggest thing Ill do if we defeat this man because he wants to get rid of Social Security he thinks that theres plenty to cut in Social Security Hes wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare both times And thats with – and if you look at the program put forward by the House Republican Caucus that he I believe supports is in fact wanting to cut it as well The idea that we dont need to protect our seniors is ridiculous We put – and by the way the American public has greater health care coverage today than ever before And under the ACA as I said youre in a circumstance where  people – I mean  million people – would not have insurance because they have a preexisting condition The only thing that allows them to have that insurance is the fact that they in fact are part of the ACA And by the way the other thing is were in a situation where I talk about education for black communities Ive raised the number the amount of money for Pell grants by other  for anybody making under  a year are going to be able to get  towards their tuition Its just – he – he just doesnt know what hes talking about
 The idea that veterans are not being taken care of I told you before – and by the way when I said “suckers and losers” he said – he acknowledged after it that he fired that general That general got fired because hes the one that acknowledged that thats what he said He was the one standing with Trump when he said it number one Number two the idea that were going to be in a situation where all these millions and millions the way he talks about it illegal aliens are coming into the country and taking away our jobs theres a reason why we have the fastestgrowing economy in the world a reason why we have the most successful economy in the world Were doing better than any other nation in the world And by the way those  Nobel laureates he talked about being phony those  Nobel laureates economists they all said that if Trump is reelected were likely to have a recession and inflation is going to increasingly go up And by the way worst president in history –  presidential scholars voted him the worst president in the history of the United States of America
 We are the most admired country in the world Were the United States of America Theres nothing beyond our capacity We have the finest military in the history of the world The finest in the history of the world No one thinks were weak No one wants to screw around with us Nobody Number one Number two the idea that were talking about worst presidents I wasnt joking Look it up Go online  or  dont hold me to the exact number presidential historians Theyve had meetings and they voted whos the worst president in American history One through best to worst They said he was the worst in all of American history Thats a fact Thats not conjecture He can argue they are wrong but thats what they voted The idea that he is knowing ph – doing anything to deal with child care He did very – virtually nothing to child care We should significantly increase the child care tax credit We should significantly increase the availability of women and men for child or single parents to be able to go back to work and we should encourage businesses to hold – to have child care facilities
 Look the fact of the matter is that hes dead wrong about it Hes increased the tariff – hes increased – he will increase the taxes on middle class people I said Id never raise a tax on anybody making less than  I didnt But this tariff this  percent tariffs Everything coming into the country you know what the economists say Thats going to cost the average American  a year and more because theyre going to have to pay the difference in food and all the things that are very important Number two hes in a situation where he talks about how he has not raised – he somehow helped the middle class The middle class has been devastated by you Now you want a new tax cut of  trillion over the next ten years which is going to fundamentally bankrupt the country You had the largest deficit of any president in American history number one Number two you have not in fact made any contact any progress with China We are the lowest trade deficit with China since 
 Fentanyl and the byproducts of fentanyl went down for a while And I wanted to make sure we use the machinery that can detect fentanyl these big machines that roll over everything that comes across the border and it costs a lot of money That was part of this deal we put together this bipartisan deal More fentanyl machines were able to detect drugs more numbers of agents more numbers of all the people at the border And when we had that deal done he went – he called his Republican colleagues said dont do it Its going to hurt me politically He never argued its not a good bill Its a really good bill We need those machines We need those machines And were coming down very hard in every country in Asia in terms of precursors for fentanyl And Mexico is working with us to make sure they dont have the technology to be able to put it together Thats what we have to do We need those machines
 Well first of all I spent half my career being – being criticized being the youngest person in politics I was the secondyoungest person ever elected to the United States Senate And now Im the oldest This guys three years younger and a lot less competent I think that just look at the record Look what Ive done Look how Ive turned around the horrible situation he left me As I said  million new jobs  manufacturing jobs more investment in America over millions – billions of dollars in private investment and – and enterprises that we are growing Weve – by the way we brought an awful a lot of people – the whole idea of computer chips We used to have  percent of the market We invented those chips And we lost it because he was sending people to cheap – to find the cheapest jobs overseas and to bring home a product So I went – I went to South Korea I convinced Samsung to invest billions of dollars here in the United States And then guess what Those fabs they call them to – to build these chips those fabs pay over  You dont need a college degree for them And theres billions about  billion already being invested and being built right now in the United States creating significant jobs for Americans all over – from all over the world
 Yeah I would The idea that somehow we are this failing country I never heard a president talk like this before We – were the envy of the world Name me a single major country president who wouldnt trade places with the United States of America For all our problems and all our opportunities were the most progressive country in the world in getting things done Were the strongest country in the world Were a country in the world who keeps our word and everybody trusts us all of our allies And our – those who he cuddles up to from Kim Jongun who he sends love letters to or Putin et cetera they dont want to screw around with us
 Youre going to see hes sixfootfive and only  pounds – or  pounds
 Well you said sixfour 
 Well anyway thats – anyway just take a look at what he says he is and take a look at what he is Look Id be happy to have a driving contest with him I got my handicap which when I was vice president down to a  And by the way I told you before Im happy to play golf if you carry your own bag Think you can do it
 I was  handicap
 Eight but I have – you know how many…
 You are a child
 If you want a World War Three let him follow ph and win and let Putin say do what you want to NATO – just do what you want Theres a thing called Article Five an attack on one is attack on all a required response The idea – the idea – I cant think of a single major leader in the world who wouldnt trade places with what job Ive done and what theyve done because we are a powerful nation we have wonderful piece ph because of the people not me because of the American people Theyre capable of anything and they step up when theyre needed And right now were needed Were needed to protect the world because our own safety is at stake And again you want to have war just let Putin go ahead and take Kyiv make sure they move on see what happens in Poland Hungary and other places along that border Then you have a war
 Lets see what your numbers are when this election is over
 Lets see Youre a whiner When you lost the first time you continued to appeal and appeal to courts all across the country Not one single court in America said any of your claims had any merit state or local none But you continue to promote this lie about somehow theres all this misrepresentation all the stealing Theres no evidence of that at all And I tell you what I doubt whether youll accept it because youre such a whiner The idea if you lose again youre accepting anything you cant stand the loss Something snapped in you when you lost the last time
 Weve made significant progress from the debacle that was left by President Trump in his – in his last term We find ourselves in a situation where number one we have to make sure that we have a fair tax system I ask anyone out there in the audience or anyone out watching this debate do you think the tax system is fair The fact is that I said nobody even making under  had a single penny increasing their taxes and it will not And if Im reelected thatll be the case again But this guy is – has increased your taxes because of the deficit Number one hes increased inflation because of the debacle he left after – when he handled the pandemic And he finds himself in a position where he now wants to tax you more by putting a  percent tariff on everything that comes into the United States America What I did when for example he wants to get away with – and get rid of the ability of Medicare to – for the ability to – for the – us to be able to negotiate drug prices with big pharma companies Well guess what We got it – we got it down to  – excuse me  for insulin instead of  No more than  for every senior no matter what they – how much prescription they need You know what that did That reduced the federal deficit ph – debt by  billion over  years because the government doesnt have to pay the exorbitant prices Im going to make that available to every senior all – or go longer Its happening now and everybody in America He wants to get rid of that We have – Im going to make sure we have childcare Were going to significantly increase the credit people have for childcare Im going to make sure we do something about what were doing on lead pipes and all the things that are causing health problems for people across the country Were going to continue to fight to bring down inflation and give people a break
