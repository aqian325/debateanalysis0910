DONALD TRUMP FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND CURRENT US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE We had the greatest economy in the history of our country We had never done so well Every – everybody was amazed by it Other countries were copying us We got hit with COVID And when we did we spent the money necessary so we wouldnt end up in a Great Depression the likes of which we had in  By the time we finished – so we did a great job We got a lot of credit for the economy a lot of credit for the military and no wars and so many other things Everything was rocking good But the thing we never got the credit for and we should have is getting us out of that COVID mess He created mandates that was a disaster for our country But other than that we had – we had given them back a – a country where the stock market actually was higher than preCOVID and nobody thought that was even possible The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounceback jobs theyre bounced back from the COVID He has not done a good job Hes done a poor job And inflations killing our country It is absolutely killing us
 Am I allowed to respond to him
 Not going to drive them higher Its just going to cause countries that have been ripping us off for years like China and many others in all fairness to China – its going to just force them to pay us a lot of money reduce our deficit tremendously and give us a lot of power for other things But he – he made a statement The only thing he was right about is I gave you the largest tax cut in history I also gave you the largest regulation cut in history Thats why we had all the jobs And the jobs went down and then they bounced back and hes taking credit for bounceback jobs You cant do that He also said he inherited  percent inflation No he inherited almost no inflation and it stayed that way for  months And then it blew up under his leadership because they spent money like a bunch of people that didnt know what they were doing And they dont know what they were doing It was the worst – probably the worst administration in history Theres never been And as far as Afghanistan is concerned I was getting out of Afghanistan but we were getting out with dignity with strength with power He got out it was the most embarrassing day in the history of our countrys life
 Because the tax cuts spurred the greatest economy that weve ever seen just prior to COVID and even after COVID It was so strong that we were able to get through COVID much better than just about any other country But we spurred – that tax spurred Now when we cut the taxes – as an example the corporate tax was cut down to  percent from  percent plus beyond that – we took in more revenue with much less tax and companies were bringing back trillions of dollars back into our country The country was going like never before And we were ready to start paying down debt We were ready to start using the liquid gold right under our feet the oil and gas right under our feet We were going to have something that nobody else has had We got hit with COVID We did a lot to fix it I gave him an unbelievable situation with all of the therapeutics and all of the things that we came up with We – we gave him something great Remember more people died under his administration even though we had largely fixed it More people died under his administration than our administration and we were right in the middle of it Something which a lot of people dont like to talk about but he had far more people dying in his administration He did the mandate which is a disaster Mandating it The vaccine went out He did a mandate on the vaccine which is the thing that people most objected to about the vaccine And he did a very poor job just a very poor job And I will tell you not only poor there but throughout the entire world were no longer respected as a country They dont respect our leadership They dont respect the United States anymore Were like a Third World nation Between weaponization of his election trying to go after his political opponent all of the things hes done weve become like a Third World nation And its a shame the damage hes done to our country And Id love to ask him and will why he allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons jails and mental institutions to come into our country and destroy our country
 Well hes right He did beat Medicaid ph He beat it to death And hes destroying Medicare because all of these people are coming in theyre putting them on Medicare theyre putting them on Social Security Theyre going to destroy Social Security This man is going to singlehandedly destroy Social Security These millions and millions of people coming in theyre trying to put them on Social Security He will wipe out Social Security He will wipe out Medicare So he was right in the way he finished that sentence and its a shame Whats happened to our country in the last four years is not to be believed Foreign countries – Im friends with a lot of people They cannot believe what happened to the United States of America Were no longer respected They dont like us We give them everything they want and they – they think were stupid They think were very stupid people What were doing for other countries and they do nothing for us What this man has done is absolutely criminal
 Correct
 First of all the Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill And I agree with their decision to have done that and I will not block it And if you look at this whole question that youre asking a complex but not really complex –  years ago you had Roe v Wade and everybody wanted to get it back to the states everybody without exception Democrats Republicans liberals conservatives everybody wanted it back Religious leaders And what I did is I put three great Supreme Court justices on the court and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v Wade and moving it back to the states This is something that everybody wanted Now  years ago or so they started talking about how many weeks and how many of this – getting into other things But every legal scholar throughout the world the most respected wanted it brought back to the states I did that Now the states are working it out If you look at Ohio it was a decision that was – that was an end result that was a little bit more liberal than you would have thought Kansas I would say the same thing Texas is different Florida is different But theyre all making their own decisions right now And right now the states control it Thats the vote of the people Like Ronald Reagan I believe in the exceptions I am a person that believes And frankly I think its important to believe in the exceptions Some people – you have to follow your heart Some people dont believe in that But I believe in the exceptions for rape incest and the life of the mother I think its very important Some people dont Follow your heart But you have to get elected also and – because that has to do with other things You got to get elected The problem they have is theyre radical because they will take the life of a child in the eighth month the ninth month and even after birth – after birth If you look at the former governor of Virginia he was willing to do this He said well put the baby aside and well determine what we do with the baby Meaning well kill the baby What happened is we brought it back to the states and the country is now coming together on this issue Its been a great thing
 There have been many young women murdered by the same people he allows to come across our border We have a border thats the most dangerous place anywhere in the world – considered the most dangerous place anywhere in the world And he opened it up and these killers are coming into our country and they are raping and killing women And its a terrible thing As far as the abortions concerned it is now back with the states The states are voting and in many cases they – its frankly a very liberal decision In many cases its the opposite But theyre voting and its bringing it back to the vote of the people which is what everybody wanted including the founders if they knew about this issue which frankly they didnt but they would have – everybody want it brought back Ronald Reagan wanted it brought back He wasnt able to get it Everybody wanted it brought back and many presidents had tried to get it back I was the one to do it And again this gives it the vote of the people And thats where they wanted it Every legal scholar wanted it that way
 So that means he can take the life of the baby in the ninth month and even after birth because some states Democratrun take it after birth Again the governor – former governor of Virginia  put the baby down then we decide what to do with it So hes in – hes willing to as we say rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month and kill the baby Nobody wants that to happen Democrat or Republican nobody wants it to happen
 Under Roe v Wade you have lateterm abortion You can do whatever you want Depending on the state you can do whatever you want We dont think thats a good thing We think its a radical thing We think the Democrats are the radicals not the Republicans
 I really dont know what he said at the end of that sentence I dont think he knows what he said either Look we had the safest border in the history of our country The border – all he had to do was leave it All he had to do was leave it He decided to open up our border open up our country to people that are from prisons people that are from mental institutions insane asylum terrorists We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now All terrorists all over the world – not just in South America all over the world They come from the Middle East everywhere All over the world theyre pouring in And this guy just left it open And he didnt need legislation because I didnt have legislation I said close the border We had the safest border in history In that final couple of months of my presidency we had according to Border Patrol – who is great and by the way who endorsed me for president But I wont say that But they endorsed me for president Brandon just speak to him But look we had the safest border in history Now we have the worst border in history Theres never been anything like it And people are dying all over the place including the people that are coming up in caravans
 Can I get one second He said we killed three people The people we killed are alBaghdadi and Salamani sic the two greatest terrorists biggest terrorists anywhere in the world And it had a huge impact on everything not just border on everything Hes the one that killed people with the bad border including hundreds of thousands of people dying and also killing our citizens when they come in We – we are living right now in a rats nest Theyre killing our people in New York in California in every state in the union because we dont have borders anymore Every state is now a border And because of his ridiculous insane and very stupid policies people are coming in and theyre killing our citizens at a level that weve never seen We call it migrant crime I call it Biden migrant crime Theyre killing our citizens at a level that weve never seen before And youre reading it like these three incredible young girls over the last few days One of them I just spoke to the mother and we just had the funeral for this girl  years old This is horrible whats taken place Whats taken place in our country were literally an uncivilized country now He doesnt want it to be He just doesnt know He opened the borders nobodys ever seen anything like And we have to get a lot of these people out and we have to get them out fast because theyre going to destroy our country Just take a look at where theyre living Theyre living in luxury hotels in New York City and other places Our veterans are on the street theyre dying because he doesnt care about our veterans He doesnt care He doesnt like the military at all And he doesnt care about our veterans Nobodys been worse I had the highest approval rating for veterans taking care of the VA He has the worst Hes gotten rid of all the things that I approved choice that I got through Congress All of the different things I approved they abandoned We had by far the highest and now its down in less than half because hes done – all these great things that we did – and I think he did it just because I approved it which is crazy But he has killed so many people at our border by allowing…
 … all of these people to come in
 And its a very sad day in America
 First of all that was a madeup quote suckers and losers They made it up It was in a thirdrate magazine thats failing like many of these magazines He made that up He put it in commercials Weve notified them We had  people that said I didnt say it And think of this who would say – Im at a cemetery or Im talking about our veterans – because nobodys taken better care – Im so glad this came up and he brought it up Theres nobody thats taken better care of our soldiers than I have To think that I would in front of generals and others say suckers and losers – we have  people that said it was never said by me It was made up by him just like Russia Russia Russia was made up just like the  intelligence agents are made up just like the new thing with the  economists are talking Its the same thing Fiftyone intelligence agents said that the laptop was Russia disinformation It wasnt That came from his son Hunter It wasnt Russia disinformation He made up the suckers and losers so he should apologize to me right now
 First of all our veterans and our soldiers cant stand this guy They cant stand him They think hes the worst commander in chief if thats what you call him that weve ever had They cant stand him So lets get that straight And they like me more than just about any of them And thats based on every single bit of information As far as Russia and Ukraine if we had a real president a president that knew – that was respected by Putin he would have never – he would have never invaded Ukraine A lot of people are dead right now much more than people know You know they talk about numbers You can double those numbers maybe triple those numbers He did nothing to stop it In fact I think he encouraged Russia from going in Ill tell you what happened he was so bad with Afghanistan it was such a horrible embarrassment most embarrassing moment in the history of our country that when Putin watched that and he saw the incompetence that he should – he should have fired those generals like I fired the one that you mentioned and so hes got no love lost But he should have fired those generals No general got fired for the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country Afghanistan where we left billions of dollars of equipment behind we lost  beautiful soldiers and  soldiers were obliterated And by the way we left people behind too We left American citizens behind When Putin saw that he said you know what I think were going to go in and maybe take my – this was his dream I talked to him about it his dream The difference is he never would have invaded Ukraine Never Just like Israel would have never been invaded in a million years by Hamas You know why Because Iran was broke with me I wouldnt let anybody do business with them They ran out of money They were broke They had no money for Hamas They had no money for anything No money for terror Thats why you had no terror at all during my administration This place the whole world is blowing up under him
 I never said that
 No theyre not acceptable No theyre not acceptable But look this is a war that never should have started If we had a leader in this war – he led everybody along Hes given  billion now or more to Ukraine Hes given  billion Thats a lot of money I dont think theres ever been anything like it Every time that Zelenskyy comes to this country he walks away with  billion Hes the greatest salesman ever And Im not knocking him Im not knocking anything Im only saying the money that were spending on this war and we shouldnt be spending it should have never happened I will have that war settled between Putin and Zelenskyy as presidentelect before I take office on January th Ill have that war settled People being killed so needlessly so stupidly and I will get it settled and Ill get it settled fast before I take office
 Just going back to Ukraine for one second we have an ocean separating us The European nations together have spent  billion or maybe more than that less than us Why doesnt he call them so you got to put up your money like I did with NATO I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars The secretary general of NATO said Trump did the most incredible job Ive ever seen You wouldnt – they wouldnt have any – they were going out of business We were spending – almost  percent of the money was – it was paid by us He didnt do that He is getting all – you got to ask these people to put up the money Were over  billion more spent and it has a bigger impact on them because of location because we have an ocean in between You got to ask them As far as Israel and Hamas Israels the one that wants to go – he said the only one who wants to keep going is Hamas Actually Israel is the one And you should them go and let them finish the job He doesnt want to do it Hes become like a Palestinian But they dont like him because hes a very bad Palestinian Hes a weak one
 Id have to see But before we do that the problem we have is that we spend all the money So they kill us on trade I made great trade deals with the European nations because if you add them up theyre about the same size economically Their economy is about the same size as the United States And they were – no cars No – they dont want anything that we have But were supposed to take their cars their food their everything their agriculture I changed that But the big thing I changed is they dont want to pay And the only reason that he can play games with NATO is because I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars I said – and hes right about this I said no Im not going to support NATO if you dont pay They asked me that question Would you guard us against Russia – at a very secret meeting of the  states at that time nations at that time And they sic said no if you dont pay I wont do that And you know what happened Billions and billions of dollars came flowing in the next day and the next months But now were in the same position Were paying everybodys bills
 Well I dont think too many believe that And let me tell you about January th on January th we had a great border nobody coming through very few On January th we were energy independent On January th we had the lowest taxes ever we had the lowest regulations ever On January th we were respected all over the world All over the world we were respected and then he comes in and were now laughed at were like a bunch of stupid people What happened to the United States reputation under this mans leadership is horrible including weaponization which Im sure at some point youll be talking about where he goes after his political opponent because he cant beat him fair and square
 Well I didnt say that to anybody I said peacefully and patriotically And Nancy Pelosi if you just watch the news from two days ago on tape to her daughter whos a documentary filmmaker as they say what shes saying oh no its my responsibility I was responsible for this Because I offered her  soldiers or National Guard and she turned them down And the mayor of – in writing by the way the mayor In writing turned it down the mayor of DC They turned it down I offered  because I could see – I had virtually nothing to do They asked me to go make a speech I could see what was happening Everybody was saying theyre going to be there on January th Theyre going to be there And I said you know what Theres a lot of people coming you could feel it You could feel it too And you could feel it And I said they ought to have some National Guard or whatever And I offered it to her And she now admits that she turned it down And it was the same day She was – I dont know you cant be very happy with her daughter because it made her into a liar She said I take full responsibility for January th
 What theyve done to some people that are so innocent you ought to be ashamed of yourself what you have done how youve destroyed the lives of so many people When they ripped down Portland when they ripped down many other cities – you go to Minnesota Minneapolis what theyve done there with the fires all over the city If I didnt bring in the National Guard that city would have been destroyed When you look at all of the – they took over big chunks of Seattle I was all set to bring in the National Guard They heard that they saw them coming and they left immediately What he said about this whole subject is so off Peacefully patriotic One other thing the unselect committee which is basically two horrible Republicans that are all gone now out of office and Democrats all Democrats they destroyed and deleted all of the information they found because they found out we were right We were right And they deleted and destroyed all of the information They should go to jail for that If a Republican did that theyd go to jail
 Well I said my retribution is going to be success Were going to make this country successful again because right now its a failing nation My retributions going to be success But when he talks about a convicted felon his son is a convicted felon at a very high level His son is convicted Going to be convicted probably numerous other times He should have been convicted before but his Justice Department let the statute of limitations lapse on the most important things But he could be a convicted felon as soon as he gets out of office Joe could be a convicted felon with all of the things that hes done Hes done horrible things All of the death caused at the border telling the Ukrainian people that were going to want a billion dollars or you change the prosecutor otherwise youre not getting a billion dollars If I ever said that thats quid pro quo That – were not going to do anything were not going to give you a billion dollars unless you change your prosecutor having to do with his son This man is a criminal This man – youre lucky Youre lucky I did nothing wrong Wed have a system that was rigged and disgusting I did nothing wrong
 I didnt have sex with a porn star number one Number two that was a case that was started and moved – they moved a highranking official a DOJ into the Manhattan DAs office to start that case That case is going to be appealed in one We had a very terrible judge a horrible judge Democrat The prosecutor were all highranking Democrats appointed people And the – both the civil and the criminal He basically went after his political opponent because he thought it was going to damage me But when the public found out about these cases – because they understand it better than he does he has no idea what these cases are But when he – they – when they found out about these cases you know what they did My poll numbers went up way up You know that because youre reporting it And we took in more money in the last two weeks than weve ever taken in in the history of any campaign I dont think any campaign has ever taken Hundreds of millions of dollars came pouring in because the public knows its a scam and its a guy thats after his political opponent because he cant win fair and square
 Jake both of you know that storys been totally wiped out Because when you see the sentence it said  percent exoneration on there So he just keeps it going He says he ran because of Charlottesville He didnt run because of Charlottesville He ran because it was his last chance at – hes not equipped to be president You know it and I know it Its ridiculous We have a debate Were trying to justify his presidency His presidency his – without question the worst president the worst presidency in the history of our country We shouldnt be having a debate about it Theres nothing to debate He made up the Charlottesville story and youll see its debunked all over the place Every anchor has – every reasonable anchor has debunked it And just the other day it came out where it was fully debunked Its a nonsense story He knows that And he didnt run because of Charlottesville He used that as an excuse to run
 And he caused the inflation Hes blaming inflation And hes right its been very bad He caused the inflation and its killing black families and Hispanic families and just about everybody Its killing people They cant buy groceries anymore They cant You look at the cost of food where its doubled and tripled and quadrupled They cant live Theyre not living anymore He caused this inflation I gave him a country with no essentially no inflation It was perfect It was so good All he had to do is leave it alone He destroyed it with his green new scam and all of the other – all this money thats being thrown out the window He caused inflation As sure as youre sitting there the fact is that his big kill on the black people is the millions of people that hes allowed to come in through the border Theyre taking black jobs now and it could be  It could be  and even  million people Theyre taking black jobs and theyre taking Hispanic jobs and you havent seen it yet but youre going to see something thats going to be the worst in our history
 Well let me just go back to what he said about the police how close the police are to him Almost every police group in the nation from every state is supporting Donald J Trump almost every police group And what he has done to the black population is horrible including the fact that for  years he called them super predators We cant in the s ph we cant forget that Super predators was his name And he called it to them for  and theyve taken great offense at it and now they see it happening But when they see what I did for criminal justice reform and for the historically black colleges and universities where I funded them and got them all funded and the opportunity zones with Tim As you know Tim Scott was  incredible he did a great job a great Senator from South Carolina He came to me with the idea and it was a great idea Its one of the most successful economic development acts ever in the country opportunity zones And the biggest beneficiary are blacks And thats why we have the best numbers with them in maybe ever theyre saying ever I read this morning wherever the best numbers he has lost much of the black population because he has done a horrible job for black people He has also done a horrible job for Hispanics But why do you see these millions of people pouring into our country and theyre going to take the jobs And its already started And you havent seen anything yet Its a disaster
 So I want absolutely immaculate clean water and I want absolutely clean air and we had it We had HO We had the best numbers ever And we did – we were using all forms of energy all forms everything And yet during my four years I had the best environmental numbers ever And my top environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on the stage actually
 The Paris Accord was going to cost us a trillion dollars and China nothing and Russia nothing and India nothing It was a ripoff of the United States And I ended it because I didnt want to waste that money because they treat us horribly We were the only ones – it was costing us money Nobody else was paying into it And it was a disaster But everything that he said just now Ill give you an example I heard him say before insulin Im the one that got the insulin down for the seniors I took care of the seniors What he is doing is destroying all of our medical programs because the migrants coming in They want everybody And look I have the biggest heart on the stage I guarantee you that And I want to take care of people But were destroying our country Theyre taking over our schools our hospitals and theyre going to be taking over Social Security He is destroying Social Security Medicare and Medicaid
 So Ive dealt with politicians all my life Ive been on this side of the equation for the last eight years Ive never seen anybody lie like this guy He lies – Ive never seen it He could look you in the face So – and about so many other things too And we mentioned the laptop We mentioned “Russia Russia Russia” “Ukraine Ukraine Ukraine” And everything he does is a lie Its misinformation and disinformation The “losers and suckers” story that he made up is a total lie on the military Its a disgrace But Social Security hes destroying it Because millions of people are pouring into our country and theyre putting them on to Social Security theyre putting them on to Medicare Medicaid Theyre putting them in our hospitals Theyre taking the place of our citizens Theyre – what theyre doing to the VA to our veterans is unbelievable Our veterans are living in the street and these people are living in luxury hotels He doesnt know what hes doing And it – its really coming back Ive never seen such anger in our country before
 Just to go back The general got fired because he was no good And if he said that thats why he made it up But we have  people that said I didnt say it and theyre very highly respected much more so than him The other thing is he doesnt fire people He never fired people Ive never seen him fire anybody I did fire a lot I fired Comey because he was no good I fired a lot of the top people at the FBI drained the swamp They were no good Not easy to fire people Youd pay a price for it but they were no good I inherited these people I didnt put him there I didnt put Comey there He was no good I fired him This guy hasnt fired anybody He never fires He should have fired every military man that was involved with that Afghan – the Afghanistan horror show The most embarrassing moment in the history of our country He didnt fire Did you fire anybody Did you fire anybody thats on the border thats allowed us to have the worst border in the history of the world Did anybody get fired for allowing  million people many from prisons many from mental institutions Did you fire anybody that allowed our country to be destroyed Joe our country is being destroyed as you and I sit up here and waste a lot of time on this debate This shouldnt be a debate He is the worst president He just said it about me because I said it But look hes the worst president in the history of our country Hes destroyed our country Now all of a sudden hes trying to get a little tough on the border He come out – came out with a nothing deal and it reduced it a little bit A little bit like this much Its insignificant He wants open borders He wants our country to either be destroyed or he wants to pick up those people as voters And I dont think – we just cant let it happen If he wins this election our country doesnt have a chance Not even a chance of coming out of this rut We probably wont have a country left anymore Thats how bad it is He is the worst in history by far
 Just you understand we have polling We have other things that do – they rate him the worst because what hes done is so bad And they rate me – yes Ill show you I will show you And they rate me one of the best OK And if Im given another four years I will be the best I think Ill be the best Nobodys ever created an economy like us Nobody ever cut taxes like us Hes the only one I know He wants to raise your taxes by four times He wants to raise everybodys taxes by four times He wants the Trump tax cuts to expire so everybody including the two of you are going to pay four to five times Nobody ever heard of this before All my life Id grow up and Id see politicians talking about cutting taxes When we cut taxes as I said we did more business Apple and all these companies they were bringing money back into our country The worst president in history by far and everybody knows it
 To finish up we now have the largest deficit in the history of our country under this guy we have the largest deficit with China He gets paid by China Hes a Manchurian candidate He gets money from China So I think hes afraid to deal with him or something But do you notice He never took out my tariffs because we bring in so much money with the tariffs that I imposed on China He never took them away He cant because its too much money Its tremendous And we saved our steel industries And there was more to come but he hasnt done that But he hasnt cut the tariffs because he cant because its too much money But hes got the largest deficit in the history of our country and hes got the worst situation with China China is going to own us if you keep allowing them to do what theyre doing to us as a country They are killing us as a country Joe and you cant let that happen Youre destroying our country
 Jake were doing very well at addiction until the COVID came along We had the twoandahalf almost three years of like nobodys ever had before any country in every way And then we had to get tough And it was – the drugs pouring across the border were – it started to increase We got great equipment We bought the certain dog Thats the most incredible thing that youve ever seen the way they can spot it We did a lot And we had – we were getting very low numbers Very very low numbers Then he came along The numbers – have you seen the numbers now Its not only the  million people that I believe is even low because the gotaways they dont even talk about gotaways But the numbers of – the amount of drugs and human trafficking in women coming across our border the worst thing Ive ever seen at numbers – nobodys ever seen under him because the border is so bad But the number of drugs coming across our border now is the largest weve ever had by far
 Because this does pertain to it He ended remain in Mexico he ended catch and release I made it catch and release in Mexico not catch and release here We had so many things that we had done hard negotiations with Mexico and I got it all for nothing Its just like when you have a hostage we always pay  billion for a – every time we sees hostage Now we have a hostage A Wall Street Journal reporter I think a good guy and hes over there because Putin is laughing at this guy probably asking for billions of dollars for the reporter I will have him out very quickly as soon as I take office before I take office I said by literally as soon as I win the election I will have that reporter out He should have had him out a long time ago But Putin is probably asking for billions and billions of dollars because this guy pays it every time We had two cases where we paid  billion for five people I got  people out and I paid essentially nothing
 Well I took two tests cognitive tests I aced them both of them as you know We made it public He took none Id like to see him take one just one a real easy one Like go through the first five questions he couldnt do it But I took two cognitive tests I took physical exams every year And you know we knock on wood wherever we may have wood that Im in very good health I just won two club championships not even senior two regular club championships To do that you have to be quite smart and you have to be able to hit the ball a long way And I do it He doesnt do it He cant hit a ball  yards He challenged me to a golf match He cant hit a ball  yards I think Im a very good shape I feel that Im in as good a shape as I was   years ago Actually Im probably a little bit lighter But Im in as good a shape as I was years ago I feel very good I feel the same But I took – I was willing to take a cognitive test And you know what if I didnt do well – I aced them Dr Ronny Jackson whos a great guy when he was White House doctor And then I took another one a similar one and both – one of them said theyd never seen anybody ace them
 inaudible
 inaudible
 Thats the biggest lie that hes a  handicap of all
 Yeah
 Ive seen your swing I know your swing CROSSTALK
 Lets not act like children
 Well I shouldnt have to say that but of course I believe that Its totally unacceptable
 And if you would see my statements that I made on Twitter at the time and also my statement that I made in the Rose Garden you would say its one of the strongest statements youve ever seen In addition to the speech I made in front of I believe the largest crowd Ive ever spoken to and I will tell you nobody ever talks about that They talk about a relatively small number of people that went to the Capitol And in many cases were ushered in by the police And as Nancy Pelosi said it was her responsibility not mine She said that loud and clear But the answer is if the election is fair free and I want that more than anybody And Ill tell you something – I wish he was a great president because I wouldnt be here right now Id be at one of my many places enjoying myself I wouldnt be under indictment because I wouldnt have been his political appoint – you know opponent Because he indicted me because I was his opponent I wish he was a great president I would rather have that I wouldnt be here I dont mind being here but the only reason Im here is hes so bad as a president that Im going to make America great again Were going to make America great again Were a failing nation right now Were a seriously failing nation And were a failing nation because of him His policies are so bad His military policies are insane Theyre insane These are wars that will never end with him He will drive us into World War Three and were closer to World War Three than anybody can imagine We are very very close to World War Three and hes driving us there And Kim JongUn and President Xi of China – Kim JongUn of North Korea all of these – Putin – they dont respect him They dont fear him They have nothing going with this gentleman and hes going to drive us into World War Three
 Just to finish what he said if I might Russia – they took a lot of land from Bush They took a lot of land from Obama and Biden They took no land nothing from Trump nothing He knew not to do it Hes not going to play games with me He knew that I got along with him very well but he knew not to play games He took nothing from me but now hes going to take the whole thing from this man right here Thats a war that should have never started It wouldve never started ever with me And hes going to take Ukraine and you know you asked me a question before would you do this with – hes got us in such a bad position right now with Ukraine and Russia because Ukraines not winning that war He said I will never settle until such time – theyre running out of people theyre running out of soldiers theyve lost so many people Its so sad Theyve lost so many people and theyve lost those gorgeous cities with the golden domes that are yearsold all because of him and stupid decisions Russia wouldve never attacked if I were president
 If its a fair and legal and good election – absolutely I would have much rather accepted these but the fraud and everything else was ridiculous that if you want well have a news conference on it in a week or well have another one of these on – in a week But I will absolutely – theres nothing Id rather do It would be much easier for me to do that than Im running again I wasnt really going to run until I saw the horrible job he did Hes destroying our country I would be very happy to be someplace else in a nice location someplace And again no indictments no political opponents stuff because its the only way he thinks he can win But unfortunately its driven up by numbers and driven it up to a very high level because the people understand it
 Well see
 Like so many politicians this man is just a complainer He said we want to do this We want to do that We want to get rid of this tax that tax but he doesnt do anything He doesnt do All he does is make our country unsafe by allowing millions and millions of people to pour in Our military doesnt respect him We look like fools in Afghanistan We didnt stop – Israel it was such a horrible thing that would have never happened It should have never happened Iran was broke Anybody that did business with Iran including China they couldnt do business with the United States They all passed Iran was broke They had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah for terror no money whatsoever Again Ukraine should have never happened He talks about all this stuff but he didnt do it For threeandahalf years were living in hell We have the Palestinians and we have everybody else rioting all over the place You talk about Charlottesville This is  times Charlottesville  times The whole country is exploding because of you because they dont respect you And they have to respect their president and they dont respect you throughout the world What we did was incredible We re – rebuilt the military We got the largest tax cut in history the largest regulation cut in history The reason hes got jobs is because I cut the regulations that gave jobs but hes putting a lot of those regulations back on All of the things that weve done nobodys ever – never seen anything like – even from a medical standpoint Right to Try where we can try Space Age materials instead of going to Asia or going to Europe and trying to get when youre terminally ill Now you can go and you can get something You sign a document Theyve been trying to get it for  years But you know what we did for the military was incredible Choice for our soldiers where our soldiers instead of waiting for three months to see a doctor can go out and get themselves fixed up and readied up and take care of themselves and theyre living And thats why I had the highest approval rating of the history of the VA So all of these things – were in a failing nation but its not going to be failing anymore Were going to make it great again
